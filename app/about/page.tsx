            <p>
              I'm Samuel Oâ€™Brien, a front-end software engineer with over 7
              years of experience creating performant, data-driven web
              applications using React, Next.js, and TypeScript. Iâ€™ve worked on
              high performing fullstack & frontend teams at startups and
              enterprises, where Iâ€™ve built advanced charting tools, large-scale
              AI/ML evaluation tools, and accessibility-compliant component
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about clean code, performance, and accessible user
              experiences. I love building high throughput, native-feeling UIs
              that empower users, as well as tools that unlock developer
              productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I love to get outside, take photographs, read
              books, and learn as much as possible. Catch me on the trails
              during the warmer months, or start a friend streak on Duolingo ðŸ¦‰

            <h2 className="text-[#5cdb95]">My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              My journey in tech began with a curiosity about how things work on
              the web. This curiosity has driven me to continuously learn and
              explore new technologies, mostly self taught, since middle school.
              I've tinkered with web technologies since the days of table
              layouts and Flash animations. Over the years, I've transitioned to
              a professional developer, providing my skills to startup and
              enterprise teams.
